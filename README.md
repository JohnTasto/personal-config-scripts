# Scripts to get my personal computer set up

Feel free to use these, but they are setup files for my personal Mac computer, they are not complete, and you probably don't want your computer configured the same way mine is anyway. They probably won't be complete until I eventually need to replace my computer and I learn everything these scripts are missing.

This repo is also missing some key bash setup files, as they contain API keys I don't particularly want to share.

I also need to figure out how to sync my Atom and VS Code config files through filesystem links, but I'm not sure how to deal with versioning. This is a low priority project for now, so I'm not going to work on it anytime soon.
