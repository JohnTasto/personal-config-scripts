# Config Scripts

These are the scripts I use to set up my computers. There is really only one main script, used to set up [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) the way I like it. I use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage [my dotfiles](https://github.com/JohnTasto/dotfiles) and [ssh-ident](https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident) to automatically load ssh keys.
